# Resume Classification Using Machine Learning

---

### About

Resume classification refers to the process of assigning resumes to specific categories or classes based on certain criteria. This can be done for various purposes, such as to identify the most qualified candidates for different types of roles or levels of experience, or to understand the skills and qualifications of job candidates in a specific field or industry.

Resume classification can be done manually by human recruiters or hiring managers, or it can be
done using machine learning algorithms. In either case, the process typically involves evaluating the
education, experience, skills, and other information listed on the resumes, and assigning them to
appropriate categories based on specific criteria. By classifying resumes, organizations can more
easily and efficiently identify the most qualified candidates and make informed hiring decisions.

In this project, multiclass classification is being used to classify resumes into multiple categories or
classes. This approach allows for the identification of the most qualified candidates for different
types of roles or levels of experience, rather than just two categories as in binary classification.
